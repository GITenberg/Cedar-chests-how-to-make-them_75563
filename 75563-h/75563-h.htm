<p>The botanical name for red cedar suitable for chest construction is
<b>Juniperus Virginiana</b>, or <b>Southern Juniper</b>, as it is familiarly known. Commercially,
it is sold as “Tennessee Red Cedar.” There are other cedar
woods but none of them should be used in chests if the great advantages
of cedar are to be derived, and especially should the “western cedar”
be avoided, as it is very common and easy to purchase, yet it has no
value as a wood for cedar chest construction. Southern Juniper may
aptly be called the “wood imperishable,” since, under ordinary conditions,
it will never decay. Placed as shingles with copper nails, there is
little doubt but that it will last for ages, or until the attacks of rain
and wind have weathered it away. Until recent years one of its greatest
uses has been in telegraph poles, fence posts, greenhouses, etc., where constant
contact with damp earth would soon rot away a less durable wood.
Now, since the rapid rise in the value of red cedar has almost prohibited
its use, cypress, “the wood eternal,” has largely succeeded it.</p>


<h3>LOG HOUSES OF RED CEDAR</h3>

<p>When America was settled, one of its most valued natural resources
was found in the red cedar belt of the South. Settlers migrating to this
region found the straight cedar logs perfectly suited to cabin construction,
consequently the best trees were felled and utilized in the building of
America’s first homes. As times went on and the settlers prospered, the
logs were taken from the houses, and assembled into barns, frame construction
taking their place in the homes. Today, these old logs, perfectly
preserved, are purchased by lumber men, as some of the most select red
cedar lumber is manufactured from them. A great many of these old logs
have been cut up into lead pencil slabs, as cedar is the best wood that has
ever been found for lead pencils. It is straight grained and easily cut with
a knife, the two necessary characteristics. Another source for pencil
supply has been found in the rail fences, so common in the South,
practically all of which were constructed of split cedar rails. This wood
is so highly prized by pencil makers that many fences have been bought
up at such prices that modern fences have taken their places, leaving a
comfortable profit for the owner.</p>


<h3>WHERE RED CEDAR ABOUNDS</h3>

<p>The geographical range of red cedar is very wide and hard to define.
Roughly speaking, it can be found westward to Minnesota, south to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Florida, and southwest through Texas. The finest forests were originally
found in middle Tennessee, in Davidson, Rutherford, Bedford, Marshall,
and Warren Counties, with a considerable quantity in the breaks of the
Cumberland plateau and in Eastern Tennessee. There was considerable
red cedar also in Southern Virginia, North Alabama and in Georgia, while
some is found in Arkansas in the Ozark Mountains.</p>
<br>

Background. Southern Maryland</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>These belts are still the most reliable source of supply, some of them
having been cut over a great many times. Second growth, although it is
stunted, more knotty, and contains more sapwood than first growth,
finds a market in fence posts and a very little in furniture construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>


<h3>DEPLETION OF THE CEDAR SUPPLY</h3>

<p>The supply of Southern Juniper in this country, both first and second
growth, is rapidly being depleted. There is no reason why this condition
should exist. The early settlers, anxious to clear their lands, destroyed it
ruthlessly, it is true, yet it
lends itself so readily to reforestation
that it is difficult
to surmise why steps to maintain
its constant supply were
not taken long ago. About
two hundred years ago, a
Swedish naturalist, Peter
Kalm, after traveling over
the settled portion of the
country, wrote at some length
upon the splendid qualities of
red cedar, and prophesied its
early extinction unless steps
were taken to replenish the
supply.</p>

Magnified 76 times.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In Poor Richard’s Almanac
for 1749, Benjamin
Franklin urged the people to
plant and foster the growth
of red cedar. He was of the opinion that the rapid clearing of the land,
the constant need of wood for fuel would soon destroy the slow-growing
oaks and other hardwoods, and that “it would be to our advantage to
endeavor to raise some other kind of timber that will grow faster or come
sooner.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The red cedar (a species of juniper) I take to be the most profitable
tree for fencing and several other uses that we can raise in our country,
considering how easily it may be raised from seeds, its readiness to grow
on most kinds of soil, its quick growth, the profits it will afford while it is
arriving at maturity, and the long duration of the wood when grown to
a proper size for the materials we want for our several occasions in
husbandry and building. I know of no other tree that will grow so well on
such different soils as this will, for upon our sandy beaches, which are
nothing but beds of sand, they grow as thick as possible, from whence
many thousand posts for fencing are brought into Pennsylvania and York
governments, and I have seen, in a great many swamps upon a branch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the Susquehannah, great trees growing, near 18 inches diameter, 70 feet
high, and very straight. And the inhabitants near the mountains, upon
Hudson Bay, make a great use of them for making large hovels or
barracks to put their corn in before it is threshed. They will grow well
in high gravely or clay soil, in rich or poor, or even upon a rock, if there
be but half a foot of land or earth upon it. It is much to be valued for
its quick growth from seed, the little sap and much durable heart,
which is acquired sooner than any tree that we can raise on common land.
Indeed, the mulberry and locust are of quick growth in very rich land,
but not upon poor.”</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>That the predictions of Kalm and Franklin have been substantiated
is a well known fact since the cedar of commercial size grown in the
Eastern and New England States—of which they spoke—has long since
been exhausted. Neither knew of the extensive cedar growths in the South
and West, yet the original growth of these regions is very near exhaustion.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>Luckily, our efficient Forest Service is at this time doing everything
in its power to encourage reforestation of the cedar tracts, and the future
of the red cedar tree looks more promising than the present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>


<h3>CHARACTERISTICS OF RED CEDAR</h3>

<p>As has been intimated, red cedar is a very durable wood. It is also
light, straight grained, does not warp readily, will dry out rapidly, takes
a beautiful finish, and has a most pleasant aroma, but one which is
moth and insect repelling. Moths shun the red cedar, as other insects
shun the pennyroyal herb.</p>

<p>These favorable characteristics all combine to make red cedar the
ideal wood for chest construction. Chests must be light, yet strong; good
to look upon when finished; of such flat stock that the finish on one side
alone will not cause the wood to warp; and they must be moth proof.
Southern Juniper furnishes all of these desirable points, and in addition
its pleasant aroma permits the immediate wearing of apparel taken from
the cedar chest without airing, as must be done with garments protected
by moth balls.</p>

<span class="fs70">Cedar Chests</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The chest, or coffer, has had a varied existence. Its present popularity
was preceded by a period in which new chests were a rarity. Previous to
this time—taking us back to our great-grandmothers’ days—the chest,
in the form of the “dower chest,” was the proud possession of every girl
with vision. Why its popularity suffered is hard to surmise, unless it was
relegated as being “old-fashioned,” and, therefore, obsolete. In recent
years those in society who make things fashionable have restored it to its
place of usefulness and beauty, and today there are very few girls whose
possessions do not include a chest.</p>


<h3>OLD ITALIAN CHESTS</h3>

<p>Long before the era of convenient furniture, chests, or coffers, were
the one article of utility in every home. In them was kept clothing, valuables
of every description, and even food-stuffs.</p>

<p>In early days, these chests were crude, ugly affairs, made for utility
alone. Later, especially in Italy, they developed into articles of beauty.</p>

<p>This development reached its height at the time of the Renaissance
when the greatest artists of the day took up the decorating of them. Carving
and painting, furnished to the wealthy at great expense, produced
articles whose magnificence is astounding. These beautiful chests were
usually presented to Italian “brides-to-be,” who kept their dowry of rich
velvets, magnificent brocade, and other treasures of maidenhood safely
under their covers.</p>

<p>With the ever-changing ideas of humanity, the beautiful chest lost
its popularity, and some wonderful specimens of Renaissance artistry were
relegated to the scrap heap. A few were saved—perhaps for the associations
they suggested—eventually to be prized and handed down from
generation to generation, preserved in the national museums, or homes
where wealth permits the collection of old furniture.</p>


<h3>NEW ENGLAND CHESTS</h3>

<p>In quaint old New England, the seventeenth century bride considered
her future happiness to depend largely upon the contents of her “dower
chest.” Every maid had one—sometimes more than one—in which she
assiduously collected her trousseau—her beautiful handmade linens, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
gorgeous silks and satins, preparatory to the day of her ascension into
home-making.</p>

<p>Nothing, perhaps, in her interesting life could she recall, in later days,
as vividly as her old dower chest, and nothing, perhaps, did she prize as
highly.</p>

<p>In those days few chests were made of cedar—oak being the wood preferred.
Using the chests, as did the old-time bride, merely to assemble her
trousseau, its storage properties were not considered as they are today.</p>


<h3>PRESENT DAY DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p>Why the chest lost its popularity is hard to determine. It may be
that moths, developing in the oak chest and devouring its contents, were a
determining factor, or it may be simply a passing whim of society that
relegated the chest. When red cedar came into favor as the universal
chest material, repelling moths and other insects, and permitting of most
beautiful finishes, the chest returned to its own.</p>

<p>The present-day mother—the far-sighted mother—is instilling the
dower chest notion into the hearts of her children as did her great-grandmother
years ago. It is not a sentimental whim which prompts her to do
this, it is strictly a utilitarian one.</p>

<p>Girls, the majority at least, will some day marry. If they have a chest
they will sew and save to fill it, if not, they may come to the altar unprepared,
or purchase at one time those things that their own labor and years
of association should endear to them. Even if they never marry, bachelor
girls must clothe themselves, and some even fit up small apartments in
which to live, hence this saving will not be a loss.</p>

<p>Cedar chests may be purchased ready made, of course, but their
rather high price prohibits their possession by some. Manual training
students or home craftsmen will find in the chest a most attractive project
of construction, and one made by a boy as a present to an older sister will
give the chest, in her sight, an added charm.</p>

<span class="fs70">How to Build a Simple Chest</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is naturally assumed that the builder of a cedar chest knows the
fundamental tool processes, as a project of this kind is no task for an absolute
beginner to attempt, hence but little attention will be paid to processes
that would ordinarily be known by the graduate of a grammar school.</p>


<h3>THE MILL BILL</h3>

<p>Chest Design Number 1, illustrated in perspective in Fig. <a href="#image017">5</a>, and whose
working drawing appears in Fig. <a href="#image018">6</a>, is of very simple construction.</p>

<p>Its stock can be purchased glued-up and sandpapered, coming to the
builder as in Fig. <a href="#image019">7</a>, almost ready to assemble, or the boards can be secured
surfaced on two sides, to be jointed, doweled, and finished by hand. Both
methods will be considered in this chapter.</p>

<p>The stock list, if the wood is to be glued-up and sandpapered at the
mill, should comprise the following pieces:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p class="no-indent">
2 pcs. red cedar for sides ¾” × 18½” × 38”<br>
2 pcs. red cedar for ends ¾” × 18½” × 19”<br>

1 pc. red cedar for feet ¾” × 2½” × 60”<br>
3 pcs. red cedar for inside strips ¾” × ¾” × 36”<br>
4 pcs. red cedar for inside corners 1¾” × 1¾” × 18”<br>

show that an allowance has been made in some instances that will need to
be cut to fit by the builder. For example, the sides are ½” wider and
about 2” longer than the working drawing calls for. This allowance has
been made so that the craftsman can secure exact dimensions with perfectly
square ends.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>As surfaced and machine sanded stock is specified, all that remains
for the builder to do is to square up the ends and edges, cut the feet and
handles, and assemble.</p>


<h3>SIDES AND ENDS</h3>

<p>Plane one edge of each side and end perfectly straight and square with
the surfaces. Check these for “working edges.” Measure over 18” and
with a straight-edge, mark the width on each. Plane carefully to this
line, keeping the edges square across.</p>

<p>With the steel square, holding the blade against the working edges in
each case, square lines across one end of each piece about ¾”.</p>

<p>Saw about ⅛” outside of these lines and plane down to them, testing
constantly with the try-square across the end grain and the steel square,
the blade of which is held against the working edge. When perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
straight and square, measure down 36” on the sides and 16½” on the
ends, square lines across, and repeat the sawing and planing.</p>


<h3>TOP AND BOTTOM</h3>

<p>The top and bottom pieces are squared up in exactly the same way,
but they finish 20” × 38”. The upper surfaces of each have their edges and
ends carefully rounded, using a radius of ¾”. This is accomplished by
planing and sandpapering with a rather coarse and then a fine sandpaper.</p>

<p>These parts are now ready to assemble, but this will not be discussed
until the hand finishing of stock is described.</p>


<h3>JOINTING AND GLUING WIDE STOCK</h3>

<p>If stock that has been machine surfaced on two sides is purchased for
the chest, the builder doing his own gluing, the following stock will be
needed:</p>

<p>
30 board feet red cedar, surfaced two sides to ⅞”<br>
1 pc. red cedar for inside corners 1¾” × 1¾” × 72”<br>
1 pc. red cedar for handles 1½” × 2” × 12¼”<br>
</p>


<h3>SAWING UP THE STOCK</h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image020" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image020.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Fig. 8</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The stock will come in pieces from 4” to 10” wide and from 8 ft. to
12 ft. long. Place the strips side by side on the saw horses, and work combinations
whereby the greatest saving of stock will be affected. There
should be about 2” allowed for jointing and squaring, making the sides
and ends, rough, 20”, and the top and bottom 22”. Saw off the lengths,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
allowing about 2” over-length in each case. Save the sawed-off ends, if
they are 7” or over in length, for the feet.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image021" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image021.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Fig. 9</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>


<h3>JOINTING</h3>

<p>Mark each piece “Side A,” “Side B,” “End A,” “End B,” etc., so
that they will not become mixed. Begin with one side, putting all other
stock away.</p>

<p>Determine by a plane stroke or two which way the grain runs in each
piece, and mark this direction by means of arrows, as in Fig. <a href="#image020">8</a>. Also,
number the adjacent edges.</p>

<p>Assuming the position of Fig. <a href="#image021">9</a>, carefully run the jointer plane over
all edges that come together. Hold it <b>down on the knob</b>, when <b>starting a
cut</b>, and <b>hard on the handle</b> when <b>finishing</b>. Keep the sides of the plane
<b>parallel</b> to the sides of the board being planed.</p>

<p>A few strokes should make the edge perfectly straight with the grain,
when it should be tested with the try-square to be certain that it is square
with the surfaces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>When it is straight as to length and square across, lay it aside and
place the edge it is to join within the vise. Do exactly the same with this
edge, and test it by placing the edge formerly planed down on top of it,
Fig. <a href="#image022">10</a>. Sighting toward the light will show whether or not exact work
has been accomplished. High spots will be easily detected and planed off.</p>

<p>If there is a <b>long, thin</b> opening in the center of the two edges, it may be
left, as the clamps will close it and when the wood dries out, end-opening
of joints will be prevented. But this opening <b>must not be more than <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>64</sub></span>”</b>
as the clamps might not pull it down and hold it if it were greater.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image022" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image022.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Fig. 10</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Repeat with the other edges, and when all boards for one side have
been joined, place them into position and test with the steel square, as in
Fig. <a href="#image023">11</a>. If they do not combine to form a straight surface, those edges
that are not square across grain must be planed.</p>


<h3>DOWELING</h3>

<p>Although stock jointed and glued up at the mill is not doweled, stock
hand jointed must be. Use ⅜” dowel pins, placed about 8” apart, the end
pins starting about 3” from the ends of the boards.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image023" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image023.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Fig. 11</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>To lay out the dowel holes, place the edges that are to be joined back
to back in the vise. With a sharp knife and the try-square, square lines
across the grain. Mark intersecting-lines with the grain with the marking
gauge, running the spur in the exact center of the edges.</p>

<p>At the intersections of the gauge and knife lines, bore ⅜” holes about
1” deep in both boards, Fig. <a href="#image024">12</a>. Slightly countersink these holes.</p>

<p>Cut the dowel pins about 1⅞” long, point their ends a little, and cut
a shallow groove along the edge to allow the surplus glue to escape, and
thus prevent splitting the boards.</p>


<h3>GLUING</h3>

<p>Place the boards in position on the saw horses near the glue pot. Have
the glue heated—if hot glue is used—and all clamps in position at hand.
Remember that you can not stop to look for anything when the hot glue is
once applied.</p>

<p>Pieces this narrow will have little tendency to buckle, especially if
the bar clamps are put on opposite sides, but it may be wise to have four
hand screws ready with battens cut the correct length in case they do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Dip the dowels, one at a time, in the glue and drive in place along one
edge of each board. Quickly tip this edge and its mate up, and apply a
thin layer of glue to each. Drop them into position and drive them together.
Repeat with the other edges, and place the bar clamps in position,
as Fig. <a href="#image025">13</a> illustrates. Tighten the clamps until all the surplus glue is
squeezed out, and apply the hand screws if the boards show any tendency
to buckle.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image024" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image024.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Fig. 12</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>It is well to warm the boards slightly if hot glue is used.</p>

<p>In case cold glue is used, allow it to stand ten or fifteen minutes before
applying the clamps. It will stick better.</p>


<h3>SURFACING</h3>

<p>After all six wide pieces have been glued up in the above manner and
allowed to dry over night, the clamps are removed and the surfaces
smoothed up.</p>

<p>Scrape off as much glue that has dried on the surfaces as possible, as
hard glue will dull the plane bit.</p>

<p>Begin with a very sharp jack plane, and plane the surface down
smooth. Cross-planing is allowable on red cedar on account of the knots,
but be very careful not to rip up deep grooves. When planed as nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
flat as possible, scrape with a sharp cabinet scraper. This should not be
held in the hand, but should be used in a scraper plane. Scraping should
remove all rough spots from the wood.</p>

<p>Finally, sandpaper the entire surface with No. 1½ sandpaper, and
finish with No. 0.</p>


<h3>SQUARING UP</h3>

<p>Cut these pieces to dimensions and square them up as has already
been described for the mill-glued stock. Pieces that have been ripped
from the edges should be saved.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image025" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</figure>
<br>


<h3>ASSEMBLING</h3>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image026">14</a> illustrates various joints used in chest construction. With the
simple design taken as our model in this chapter, we will employ the plain
butt, nailing the pieces together with 8d finishing nails.</p>

<p>It will be noticed from the working drawing that the sides are nailed
onto the ends. To prevent splitting, a number of small holes should first
be drilled through the sides. Apply glue to the ends before driving the
nails in place.</p>
<br>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>

<p class="center no-indent">Fig. 14</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>When the sides and ends have been assembled, cut a stick the length
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>of one diagonal of the box, and use this to test on the other diagonal. If
the box is square, both diagonals will be the same length.</p>

<p>Place the bottom side up and screw the bottom to the sides and ends.
Use 1¾” No. 8 flat head screws well countersunk. Bore the holes through
the bottom rather large to allow for any expansion or contraction, and
use about twelve screws.</p>


<h3>TRIANGULAR CORNER STRIPS</h3>

<p>In the inside corners of the box, triangular strips should be securely
glued. They are made by ripping on the diagonal of the 1¾” square pieces,
and should be made 17” long, Fig. <a href="#image027">15</a>. They help to strengthen the chest.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image027" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image027.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Fig. 15</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>


<h3>FEET</h3>

<p>The working drawing gives a detail of the feet. Two pieces 7” long
and 2½” wide are cut to shape as shown. Their adjoining ends are mitered,
glued, and nailed. On the inside corner a block 1¾” square is glued to help
strengthen the joint and to carry the caster. These feet are screwed onto
the bottom piece.</p>


<h3>HANDLES</h3>

<p>Handles may be purchased, but they are so easily made that they are
not worth the expense involved. The working drawing gives a detail of a
good shape, but this is only a suggestion. The inside is gouged out for a
finger hold.</p>

<p>The handles are attached with flat head screws from the inside of
the box, and glued.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>


<h3>THE COVER</h3>

<p>A good chest is dust-proof. There are three ways of rendering it so
illustrated in Fig. <a href="#image028">16</a>. The first has false edges glued around the under
edges of the top, this false edge extending down over the sides and ends.
The third has a strip fastened to the top inside of the edges and ends, while
the second is a combination of the other two.</p>

<p>In our example, the third method will be employed.</p>

<p>Cut two strips 34½” long from stock ¾” square, and two pieces 15”
long. Screw and glue them in place.</p>


<h3>HINGING</h3>

<p>Two plain butt hinges 21” long with a ¾” leaf will do on this chest.
They may be let into both the top and the upper edge of the side piece, or
entirely into the edge. Another method often used in schools is that of
placing the hinges on the outside of the back and the under side of the top.
This is the most simple as it involves no chiseling, and, since the chest
is usually placed against a wall, does not look bad, especially if an ornamental
hinge is used.</p>

<p>Two chains or desk supports should be used to prevent the lid from
swinging way back and straining the hinges. See Fig. <a href="#image064">52</a>, Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">VII</a>.</p>


<h3>FINISHING</h3>

<p>Directions for finishing and preparing the wood for finish are given in
Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_V">V</a>. Of course the nails should be well set and filled as explained.</p>

<span class="fs70">Cedar Chest Designs</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Variety in design is so essential in cabinet making classes that a number
of different styles of chests are presented in this chapter. Although a
great many teachers follow the practice of giving the student a working
drawing to follow, it is recommended that the designs herewith presented
be used only as models—that from them each boy will combine, and add
his own ideas to evolve what may be called “an original design.” Only
by so doing will the student derive his greatest benefit from the work.</p>


<h3>DESIGN NO. 2</h3>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#image031">18</a> is presented a perspective of the chest whose working drawing
is given in Fig. <a href="#image030">17</a>. This chest is very similar to Design No. <a href="#image018">1</a> described
in the previous chapter. Its dimensions are practically the same, but in
this case, the ends are fastened to the sides, and the end grain—appearing
on the front—is covered by a curved piece of cedar 1¾” wide. The feet
also differ as the detail shows.</p>
<br>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 3</h3>

<p>In this design we have a larger chest than the previous, but whose
construction is the same. The end grain, appearing on the front, is covered
with strips of copper. These may be put on as corners extending over the
ends also, or merely as plates on the front, as Fig. <a href="#image033">20</a> illustrates. The feet
are detailed with Design No. <a href="#image018">1</a>.</p>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 4</h3>

<p>One of the most popular chest designs is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#image034">21</a>. In this,
the edges are rounded, giving it an easy, graceful appearance. It requires
careful, accurate work, as the joints can not be covered with strips or
copper as with the previous styles.</p>
<br>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 5</h3>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#image037">24</a> is shown a chest whose design permits it to be used as a
window seat when covered with a cushion. Its appearance is very attractive
as it has heavy, massive ends, giving it an air of solidity. The
ends can be built up flush, as the drawing, Fig. <a href="#image036">23</a>, illustrates, or paneled.
A ¾” strip is glued to the front edge of the top, making it appear to be as
thick as the ends. The drawings illustrate copper plates on the front,
but, if good work is accomplished, these may well be omitted.</p>
<br>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 6</h3>

<p>A paneled chest, Figs. <a href="#image038">25</a> and <a href="#image039">26</a>, looks well when accurate work has
been done. It, of course, means a great deal of mortising and routing, but,
where power machines are available, does not consume a great amount of
time. A chest built up as previously described with ¼” strips glued on will
give the same effect. A study of both drawings will make the construction
clear to the average student.</p>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 7</h3>

<p>Design No. <a href="#image040">7</a>, Figs. <a href="#image040">27</a> and <a href="#image041">28</a>, is a rather odd design from the fact
that it contains a drawer. It is built in the usual manner, but has two
bottoms and an opening in the front for the drawer to slide into. It should
be built of cedar throughout, but a slight saving can be effected if the
lower bottom is of a cheaper wood or even a frame.</p>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 8</h3>

<p>This chest involves a little turning, but otherwise its construction is
simple. A ¾” piece is set into the upright end pieces of stock 1½” × 1¾”,
and another piece mortised in between them at the top. This latter piece
has had a handle turned in its center, and two round tenons on its ends.
These tenons are glued into holes bored in the uprights. Fig. <a href="#image042">29</a> makes
this construction clear. Aside from this, the construction is very similar
to Design No. <a href="#image036">5</a>.</p>


<h3>DESIGN NO. 9</h3>

<p>At first glance, Fig. <a href="#image045a">32</a> presents a chest of difficult design, yet a careful
understanding of its construction will show it to be quite simple. The
box is built up with plain butt ends, and four corner legs are cut out according
to the detail on Fig. <a href="#image044">31</a>. A right angle groove is cut into the center
of each leg, and this fits over the corners of the chest. Glue and long
screws from the inside of the box hold them in place, as detailed in Fig. <a href="#image045b">33</a>.
The little brackets shown in the perspective are doweled onto the legs after
the latter have been fastened in place. At the top and bottom strips of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
small moulding may be cut by hand, or special mill orders will secure it
from the dealers. The panels are made of similar mouldings but these may
be omitted if desired. The top shows a raised panel. There are two
methods used to secure this effect. In the most simple, the ¾” top is built
up and another, thinner piece, glued over it. If the shop has a veneer
press, this method is very easy. Of course there is excessive weight when
this construction is used. The alternate method is to build up a frame
with either mortised or mitered ends, and set the ¾” top into this frame.
It can be secured with nails and glue from the under side.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#image046">34</a> and <a href="#image047">35</a> illustrate a chest of the William and Mary period
style. It is built up as the others have been with plain butt joints, and
over the corners, as with Design No. <a href="#image045b">9</a>, the legs are fastened. These are
turned on a wood lathe, a quarter of the pieces being cut out. They can
be cut after the turning is finished, or before. The latter plan is the more
simple, as a frame must be constructed to hold the legs while being sawed
if they have been previously turned. If the section is removed before
turning it is a good plan to make the two circular saw cuts through the
middle of the piece without cutting through to the ends. This will permit
good centers to be obtained, and it may prevent excessive chipping of the
edges. The wood can be removed when the ends are cut off on the lathe,
or they may be carefully chiseled out. The panel effect is secured with
small mouldings mitered at their corners. These may be omitted, if desired,
without spoiling the appearance of the chest.</p>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 11</h3>

<p>This chest is of very simple design, and would not be too difficult a
project for the average eighth-grade student. The ends are butted
against the front and back, and fastened with fine finishing nails. Corner
blocks are used on the inside, of course. The bottom is a mitered frame
which is nailed to the box. The handles are worked out from small
pieces of stock, 1½” thick. The top is built up with a mitered frame,
securely glued and nailed. Fig. <a href="#image048">36</a> is the working drawing, and Fig. <a href="#image049">37</a>
presents a photograph of the finished chest.</p>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 12</h3>

<p>Figs. <a href="#image050">38</a> and <a href="#image051">39</a> illustrate a chest very similar in construction to those already described,
but one differing in mode of trimming. In this project Decalcomania transfers
are successfully used, a description of which will be found in Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">VI</a>.</p>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 13</h3>

<p>This very attractive chest is identical in construction with Design No. <a href="#image050">12</a>, but in this case
the chest is embellished with two well designed metal corners fastened with large-headed brass
or copper nails. It will be noted that no corners are used at the back; however, it would not
look out of place to fasten plates on the ends to give the appearance of corners.</p>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 14</h3>

<p>The only unique parts of the chest illustrated in Figs. <a href="#image054">42</a> and <a href="#image055">43</a> are the feet. After carefully forming
them, they should be attached to the chest bottom before it is fastened to the box, as in this way the
screws used to hold them can be evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 15</h3>

<p>In Figs. <a href="#image056">44</a> and <a href="#image057">45</a> we have a number of departures from the chests previously described. The most
noticeable of these is the edge around the top, which is built-up from strips one and three-fourths inches
square. The edges of these strips are carefully rounded and the outside tapered in toward the bottom.
Another point to note is that the feet are not set in or out from the body of the chest, but are so fastened
that they give the appearance of flush sides and ends. These latter are mitered together at the corners.</p>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 16</h3>

<p>This chest is almost identical in design with No. <a href="#image052">13</a>, excepting that it has an overhanging top. When
the box has been completed, a cove moulding is glued and bradded flush with the upper edges, and the
top fitted over this moulding. As it is impossible to secure this moulding already cut from red cedar, it
will be necessary to put in a special order for it at the mill or to work it out with a combination plane.</p>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 18</h3>

<p>This chest is almost identical with Design No. <a href="#image034">4</a>. It is built in the same manner, but here we
have Decalcomania decorations applied, and the dimensions differ. When carefully constructed this
is one of the most attractive designs in the series.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#image064">52</a> and <a href="#image065">53</a> present another chest with paneled ends, and the sectional view in the
working drawing shows the construction of them. The rails are mortised into the post, and
on the front panel, the wide edge is relieved by attaching a small quarter-round. The end
panel is set into the rails at the center, hence it is not necessary to use the moulding here.</p>

<h3>DESIGN NO. 20</h3>

<p>With a proper selection of transfer designs, this chest is one of the most attractive that it is
possible to build. Its construction is simple and it has the wide curved pieces over the end grain
that were first shown in Design No. <a href="#image030">2</a>.</p>

<p>Although larger than No. <a href="#image066">20</a>, this chest is practically the same with the exception of its
decoration. Decalcomanias are not used here, but hinge plates and a well designed copper
decoration on the front, add the hit of relief so urgently desired.</p>

meant to roll under the bed. It is of very simple construction, and most
useful in small bedrooms and flats.</p>

<h3>CHEST OF DRAWERS</h3>

<p>A chest of cedar drawers, Fig. <a href="#image073b">62</a>, has so many advantages that little
need be said concerning it. Its additional room and separate compartments
commend it highly. Its construction is exactly like the usual
cabinet construction, all parts, wherever possible, being mortised and
tenoned together. The detail of the drawer construction, Fig. <a href="#image075">64</a>, shows
the fronts to extend past the sides, the edges being rounded. This gives
the chest a most pleasing appearance and renders it dust-proof. If desired,
the upper section, instead of having a large drawer, can have a false
drawer front, and a bottom put in. The top can then be hinged and a
high chest with two drawers will result. Or the top drawer may be
divided into two smaller drawers with good effect.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#image076">65</a> and <a href="#image077">66</a> illustrate a few additional designs whose working
drawings are not given. They may offer suggestions worth while when
the builder is designing his own. The feet are especially suggestive.</p>

<span class="fs70">The Finishing of Cedar</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Red cedar, contrary to supposition, is not a hard wood to finish.
Having a closed grain, it needs no filler, which greatly simplifies its
finishing. The outside, and the inner side of the cover—to prevent
warping—should be finished; <b>never the inside of the chest</b>.</p>


<h3>PREPARING THE WOOD FOR FINISHING</h3>

<p>The cedar chest should be prepared for finishing as any other piece
of furniture is prepared. All glue and rough spots should be carefully
scraped and sandpapered until the surface is entirely free from defects.
If the wood in the chest has been purchased glued up and machine sandpapered,
it will need a final sandpapering with No. 0 or No. 00 sandpaper.
If worked down by hand, it will need a great deal of scraping with a <b>sharp</b>
scraper, a preliminary rubbing with No. 1 sandpaper, and a final rubbing
with No. 0, working <b>with the grain</b> in each case. Careful dusting preparatory
to the application of the first coat of finish is very necessary.</p>


<h3>FILLING ROUGH SPOTS</h3>

<p>As red cedar contains a great many knots, planing the wood by hand—and
occasionally by machine—causes rough spots to occur around the
knots. If these rough spots are shallow, they can be scraped out and
sandpapered, but if they are deep, they must be filled.</p>

<p>There are a number of methods of filling. The most simple—and
least satisfactory—method is to fill them with “water putty,” a dry
crack filler purchased in powder form and mixed with water. When it
has hardened it can be rubbed down with sandpaper and colored to match
the surrounding wood. As this color will fade in time, this method is not
recommended.</p>

<p>A better method is to fill them with a colored wood filler. Secure a
small can of natural paste wood filler, a little rose pink dry stain, and some
Van Dyke brown dry stain. Thin the filler with turpentine or benzine
and add a quantity of the Van Dyke brown, well stirred in. Compare
this color with that of the knots around which you are going to fill and add
the rose pink until the correct shade of red is obtained. Apply this filler
to the knots, and when perfectly dry, sandpaper down to an even surface.</p>

<p>A third method—much slower than the other two—is the application
of successive coats of colored shellac. To the ordinary shellac, add a little
Bismark brown dry stain until you get a color that will match, when dry,
the wood surrounding the rough spots. Apply this and allow it to set.
Sandpaper down and apply successive coats, rubbing down evenly after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
each until a level surface is obtained. Repeated coats of thin shellac will
look better and stick better than a few heavy coats.</p>


<h3>COLORING THE WOOD</h3>

<p>Some people object to the white streaks of sap wood contrasting so
strongly with the red heart wood, while others are of the opinion that this
contrast is one of the beauties of red cedar. The author is of the opinion
that the white wood is not objectionable <b>if there is not too much of it</b>.
Just what quantity to allow is again a matter of personal choice, so no
hard and fast rule can be laid down.</p>

<p>To color the chest prepare an aniline dye stain of red and brown.
Cover the entire piece with a thin coat, then go over the lighter parts and
streaks with a stronger coat. If carefully done, this should even up the
color.</p>

<p>If the maker does not mix his own stains, a red mahogany oil stain applied
in the same manner will leave the same result. Thin the first coat
out with benzine.</p>


<h3>WAX FINISH</h3>

<p>After filling and coloring, if the latter is desired, the kind of finish
must be selected. The most simple is the wax but it is very seldom used—almost
never by cedar chest manufacturers. But since it is often employed
by students and home craftsmen it will be described.</p>

<p>Over the dry surface apply a coat of thin shellac, either white or
orange. When this has thoroughly dried, rub it down lightly with No. 00
sandpaper and apply a second coat. When this has set, repeat the rubbing,
being very careful not to rub through the coat, especially on the
edges and corners. Brush on the third coat of shellac and rub it down
with a little boiled linseed oil placed on the No. 00 sandpaper. This should
leave a smooth, unpitted surface.</p>

<p>Finally, apply a coat of prepared floor wax and allow it to stand over
night. Rub it briskly with a dry flannel cloth, bringing it to a good polish.
If a still higher gloss is desired, put on a second coat of wax and allow it to
stand about thirty minutes before rubbing off.</p>

<p>This finish can be renewed from time to time with fresh applications
of wax, and has the advantage over the varnished surface of not showing
scratches as readily.</p>


<h3>VARNISH FINISH</h3>

<p>For a varnish finish apply but two coats of shellac in the manner
described above, and two coats of high grade rubbing varnish.</p>

<p>The temperature of the room in which the varnishing is accomplished
should be 70 degrees F. or over, and perfectly uniform. The room should
be free from dust, and kept free after the varnish has been applied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>Use an oval varnish brush, well dusted in the hand. Take up a brush
full of the liquid as it comes from the can, and, starting from the center of
the top, spread it out to the edges. Where it drips over, take up this surplus
with the end of the brush. The sides should be varnished by working
down from the top edge.</p>

<p>The inside of the cover should be supported so that the air can circulate
around it, otherwise it would be very slow in drying.</p>

<p>Allow about five days for the varnish to thoroughly dry in before rubbing
it down. Then sprinkle powdered pumice stone over the surface,
and rub it with a felt pad (about 4” by 5”) moistened with water. Rub all
surfaces while they are in a horizontal position if possible. Rub <b>lightly</b>
and <b>evenly with the grain</b>, and be very sure that you do not go below the
coat in any place—edges especially.</p>

<p>Wash the pumice stone off with water and rub dry with a clean cloth
after which the second coat is applied in the same manner. Allow this
coat about five days in which to dry when the polishing process can be
started. Rub it down as before with pumice stone and water, then remove
the fine scratches left by the pumice stone by rubbing in a similar manner
with rotten stone and water. <b>Always rub with the grain if possible.</b> Next,
moisten the hand with linseed oil and sprinkle a little rotten stone in it.
Very lightly go over the entire surface with this combination, rubbing
with the grain. When perfectly smooth, clean the surface with a very soft
cloth saturated with clean oil, and rub dry with cotton batting.</p>

<p>To finish the polish, go over the entire surface with another soft pad
of cotton batting saturated with some good furniture polish, or a thin
mixture of linseed oil, turpentine, and sweet oil. This should produce an
extremely brilliant and satisfactory finish if good materials have been
used and care exercised in their application.</p>


<h3>OIL FINISH</h3>

<p>If an oil finish is desired go over the wood, after it has been filled and
colored, with a coat of <b>hot linseed oil</b>. When thoroughly dry, wipe off the
“grease spots,” if there are any, and give the wood a coat of shellac. This
can be followed with a second coat of shellac, rubbed down with pumice
stone and oil, or the varnish finish as described above can be applied over
the second coat of shellac.</p>


<h3>ENAMEL FINISH</h3>

<p>There is a modern demand evinced for enameled and painted furniture,
especially in some of the Period designs. To meet this demand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
cedar chest manufacturers have recently introduced chests enameled on
the outside, and left natural on the inside, the designs being made to correspond
with various periods—Adam and William and Mary being predominant.</p>

<p>Old ivory—a soft shade of cream—is the most popular finish, especially
when decorated parts are striped with orange, while black enamel,
striped with gold, is second best.</p>

<p>These finishes are applied in the conventional manner—the ivory
enamel being under-coated with flat white.</p>

<p>On school-made chests these finishes are not to be recommended. In
the first place, they are only temporary fads—pretty creations to catch
the popular fancy that may be “old-fashioned” next year. And secondly,
there is no good reason for hiding the natural beauties of red cedar with
enamels. Carefully selected wood, with its wonderful contrasts of sap
and heart wood, certainly give color enough.</p>


<h3>LACQUER FINISH</h3>

<p>The wood should be prepared as directed in the preceding paragraphs,
and after it has been well dusted, a coat of lacquer is applied.
This is the regular cotton lacquer (banana oil), and it must not be confounded
with the wood lacquers now so extensively advertised. When
dry it is sanded lightly and given a second coat, the spreading of which
must be done quickly and without overlapping.</p>

<p>Lacquer serves not only as a protection for the wood, but it also
acts to keep the odor of the cedar confined in the wood, and it protects
the wood against moisture better than any of the finishing coatings.
Over this second coat, apply a bit of thin wax, or a coat of rubbing
varnish, as desired.</p>

<p>This method of finishing cedar chests is one of the most common in
the furniture factories, as it preserves the full beauty of the grain.</p>

<span class="fs70">Copper Trimmings</span></h2>
</div>

<p>After the finish on the chest has thoroughly dried, any copper trimmings
desired can be applied, providing, of course, that the appearance of
the chest will be improved by them. If good joints have been obtained on
the corners, copper corners will help but little, but if the joints are open,
well-designed corners will cover up the defects without detracting from
the appearance of the chest. As a rule, handles of cedar, well executed,
look better than metal pulls attached to the ends of the box, but if metal
corners are employed the pulls should also be of the same. If a lock is
attached, it will need an escutcheon, and hinge plates on the cover go
well where the other metal trimmings are adapted.</p>

<p>Sixteen-gauge copper is the metal usually employed. Brass looks
well, but it does not harmonize with the red cedar quite as attractively
as copper.</p>

<p>The design should be first worked out on paper, and transferred to
the metal by using carbon paper. Care should be exercised with the designing.
A poor design looks worse than no design at all—copper bands
with straight edges certainly give a pleasing appearance, as Fig. <a href="#image042">29</a> shows.
The student will do well to co-operate with the art teacher when designing
his trimmings. The illustrations in this chapter offer suggestions for design,
Fig. <a href="#image083">67</a> showing escutcheons, Fig. <a href="#image084">68</a> pulls, Fig. <a href="#image085">69</a> hinge plates, and
Fig. <a href="#image086">70</a> corners. Although these designs do not emphasize it, the same motif
should be used in every case. For example, straight bands across the top
should not be used with fancy-sawed corners. A reasonably plain hinge
plate will not look well on a chest with very elaborate pulls and corners.
Care should be given this designing that the different parts do not show
incongruity.</p>


<h3>ESCUTCHEONS</h3>

<p>The escutcheon can be small and plain, or rather long and fancy.
Fig. <a href="#image083">67</a> illustrates both kinds. The design should be symmetrical about
the vertical center line. The key hole size is dependent upon the size of
the key furnished with the lock, and its distance from the upper edge is
governed by the depth of the key hole in the lock.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>After the design has been carefully traced on the metal, it should be
cut out with a fine metal saw in a jeweler’s saw frame. The edges can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>then be filed smooth. The inside cutting is accomplished by first drilling a
small hole, then inserting the saw and re-fastening it in the frame.</p>

<p>Holes drilled for the tacks will complete the construction.</p>


<h3>PULLS</h3>

<p>The backs of the pulls are sawed out exactly like the escutcheon,
the handle being the most difficult part to construct. On the even wire
design, a piece of heavy round copper can be bent to shape. It is fastened
through a piece of thinner metal, which, in turn, is spread out after passing
through a slot sawed in the plate, Fig. <a href="#image087a">71</a>. Those of uneven designs, the first
for example, can be sawed and filed from a piece of copper 1” thick, or, if
the school teaches molding, a wooden pattern the shape and size of the pull
can be made, a mold taken from it, and a copper casting made in the mold.
A little filing and polishing will put the metal pull in excellent shape.
Where the wire is thicker in the middle, it can be hammered out or filed
before bending, as in Fig. <a href="#image087b">72</a>. The boring of the nail holes in the plate will
complete the construction.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>


<h3>HINGE PLATES</h3>

<p>Hinge plates are used on the cover to give the chest a more massive
appearance. They extend to the back edge, or are bent over it. After
the design has been traced on the metal, they are sawed, filed, and the nail
holes drilled as before.</p>


<h3>CORNERS</h3>

<p>Corners are made like hinge plates with the addition of a right angle
bend in the middle. This bending is accomplished by placing the metal
between two hardwood pieces screwed up in a vise, and driving the upper
half over with a mallet. In some instances, Fig. <a href="#image032">19</a> is an example, the
corner does not go around the end, a flat plate covering the end grain
being fastened on the front only.</p>


<h3>FINISH</h3>

<p>The metal trimmings should be rubbed very briskly with fine steel
wool, and polished with water and pumice stone. They will keep this
polish if coated with banana oil or some other good lacquer. This finish
should be applied before the trimmings are fastened on the chest.</p>


<h3>NAILS</h3>

<p>Copper nails with various size heads can be obtained, or brass headed
tacks copper coated can be used in their stead. The copper plating can
be done by any plating concern, and at a very small cost.</p>


<h3>DECALCOMANIA TRANSFERS</h3>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Fig. 73 Chest Decorated with Decalcomania Transfers</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>A line of chests has recently appeared on the market with decorations
that appear to be hand painted. Fig. <a href="#image088">73</a> gives an example. This form of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
decoration results from the using of Decalcomania transfers, and, since it
is very attractive and easily applied, deserves notice in this chapter.</p>

<p>The transfers are applied in colors to the Decalcomania paper, in
which condition they reach the consumer. The face of the transfer is sized
with a thin coat of varnish, the paper is placed in position on the chest,
and is then soaked off, very much as the small boy soaks off the old-fashioned
transfer pictures from his hand or arm. The operation consumes
but very little time and when properly done, the decoration is as
much a part of the piece as the finish itself.</p>

<p>It is applied over the final finish, or it can be put on before the last
coat of varnish is placed.</p>

<p>Many excellent designs are available, especially in marquetry and
pearl inlay where the work has been reproduced so carefully as to challenge
detection. A chest decorated with a fine band of inlay lines of black
and holly presents a wonderfully attractive appearance.</p>

<p>Decalcomania transfers can be obtained only from the manufacturers.

<span class="fs70">Matting Boxes</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image090">74</a> is from a photograph of a matting box—a form of chest construction
not devoid of popularity, as its neat appearance and simple
construction make it worthy of considerable favor.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image090" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Fig. 74</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Most matting boxes are made from wood other than cedar—cypress,
redwood, etc.—most any stock that can be secured in wide pieces—thus
doing away with gluing up. The pieces are simply nailed or screwed
together, corner strips glued in, and the matting applied. Such simple
construction makes this a favorable project for grammar grade students.</p>


<h3>HOW TO MAKE A MATTING BOX</h3>

<p>California redwood is recommended, as it is light, straight grained,
and does not warp easily. Dimensions can be secured from the working
drawings of the cedar chests given in the previous chapters.</p>

<p>The flat surfaces will need little planing by hand since they will be
entirely covered on the outside. The edges should be smoothly finished,
especially the upper edges, and the under side of the top should be planed
and sandpapered.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Fig. 76</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Cut the sides and ends to the desired shape, Figs. <a href="#image091a">75</a> and <a href="#image091b">76</a> offer
excellent suggestions, and square the ends of all four pieces. Nail or screw
the boards together, and glue in triangular corner strips on the inside.</p>

<p>Nail the bottom in through the sides and ends, making the nail holes
in the ends about three times as wide as the nails to allow for expansion
and contraction, and give the sides a rather loose fit for the same reason.</p>

<p>Fit the top carefully and round its upper edges. If the board is not
flat or glued-up from narrow pieces, it may be well to glue and nail strips
on its under side to straighten it and prevent warping, as Fig. <a href="#image092">77</a> illustrates.</p>

<p>Shellac over the outside and inside of all pieces with at least two coats
of shellac, sandpapering the second on the inside. This is also done to
prevent warping.</p>
<br>

<br>


<h3>PUTTING ON THE MATTING</h3>

<p>The natural colored floor matting without decoration of any kind is
to be preferred. Trim off its thick edges, and cut the pieces carefully to
fit the surfaces, planning on the seams coming where they will be covered
with the strips of cane.</p>

<p>Allow these pieces to soak in warm water for two or three hours, then
tack them to their respective surfaces. Use ordinary carpet tacks with
large heads, or matting staples. Stretch the matting very tight over the
surface as the tacking proceeds, and when the water dries out a perfect fit
will be assured.</p>


<h3>COVERING THE SEAMS AND EDGES</h3>

<p>Split bamboo makes the best covering for the seams and edges, as it
blends so well with the matting. Small fish-poles may be secured, soaked
in hot water, and carefully split with a sharp knife on a diameter, as each
section should be semi-circular. Split bamboo porch screens, at one time
so popular, can be taken apart and used, or strips may be purchased from
a manufacturer of split bamboo fish-poles through some sporting goods
dealer.</p>

<p>Cut the strips the exact lengths desired, being very careful to make
good joints, drill small holes where the nails will come, and fasten with
round-head brads or brass escutcheon pins. Curves that require much
bending can be soaked in hot water until pliable before placing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>If a little decoration is desired on the bamboo, hold it over a flame at
intervals, scorching the surface brown. Dust this off and shellac the
strips before attaching them.</p>

<p>If it is impossible to secure bamboo of any kind, small strips of any
wood stained or white enameled will serve very well.</p>

<p>Place the hinges and chain, and the box is complete.</p>


<h3>MAKING THE BOX MOTH-PROOF</h3>

<p>If a cedar chest has been constructed and poorly finished, a covering
of matting will greatly improve its appearance, and without impairing its
moth-proof qualities if it is not finished on the inside.</p>

<p>If an ordinary matting box has been made, it can be rendered moth-proof
by putting in a bottom of red cedar, or covering the bottom with
cedar shavings, also mixing shavings in with the contents of the box when
storing them.</p>
